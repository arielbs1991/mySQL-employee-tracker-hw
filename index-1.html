A program in which a user can enter information about their company, such as departments, roles, employees, managers, salaries, etc. and modify and manage the data. The company information is stored to a database using mySQL, so can be retrieved at a later time.

## Installation

From my github profile, click the mySQL-employee-tracker-hw link, and clone the repo to your computer using your terminal.

## Usage

Within your terminal, on the same root as the application, run node index, which will bring up a series of tasks to choose from, from viewing employees, roles, or departments, adding employees, roles, or departments, and removing employees, roles, and departments. After selecting one of these tasks, the user follows the list of propmpts to provide information for each subset. This application can be modified to suit any business structure, from tech to restaurants to your cousin's landscaping business. Future versions will include the ability to track employee related expenses and sorting by a broader range of criteria.

## Credits

Thanks again to the Coding Bootcamp team, Joe and Denis, you're rockstars. I am so thankful for this library of code you're helping us build that will continue to serve as a reference for years to come.
